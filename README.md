# Bard

Bard is an app that allows users to create and save a simple melody that might have spontaneously come to you, or just try out different tunes and lyrics. Currently in a very early developing stage, but functional.

### What can you do with Bard?

#### Compose songs by :
* choosing piano notes (currently one octave) from a dropdown menu.
* enter custom note durations
* enter lyrics or syllables for each note that will use TTS
* add and delete notes to make a sequence
* playback by saving to library

### Features I'd like to implement

* a better UI to simplify the composing of songs
* more octaves
* better way to sing the lyrics than TTS
* set durations according to time signatures, control speed by bpm
* functionality to playback song while composing
